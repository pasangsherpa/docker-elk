# docker-elk

> Dockerized ELK stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana.

## Installation and Setup

1. First, Install [Docker and Compose][1] **OR** Install [Vagrant][6] and [Virtualbox][7].

2. Next, clone the project.

	```
	$ git@github.com:pasangsherpa/docker-elk.git
	$ cd docker-elk
	```
	
3. Skip this step if you didn't install or don't want to use [Vagrant][6].
	
	```
	$ vagrant up
	$ vagrant ssh
	$ cd /vagrant
	```

## Configure 

1. [Elasticsearch][2] configuration files can be found under 'config/elasticsearch' folder. The folder comes with two files, the elasticsearch.yml for configuring [Elasticsearch][2] different modules, and logging.yml for configuring the [Elasticsearch][2] logging. Update these configuration files as per your need or leave it as it is. For more info checkout [Elasticsearch-setup-configuration](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html).

2. [Logstash][3] configuration file can be found under 'config/logstash/conf' folder. This is where you will define logstash inputs, filters and outputs. Default config includes setup for [logstash-forwarder][5].

3. [Kibana][4] configuration file can be found under 'config/kibana' folder.

4. Generate ssl certificate for logstash server. *Note: This step is only required if you decide to use [logstash-forwarder][5].*
	
	```
	$ cd config/logstash/tls
	
	# NOTE: replace <logstash_server_fqdn> with your logstash server dns.
	$ openssl req -subj '/CN=<logstash_server_fqdn>/' -x509 -days 3650 -batch -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private/logstash-forwarder.key -out certs/logstash-forwarder.crt
	```

## Build and run ELK with Compose

1. Build and run [elasticsearch][2] and [kibana][4] container in the background.

	```
	$ docker-compose up elasticsearch kibana -d
	```

2. Build and run [logstash][3] service.

	```
	$ docker-compose run logstash -f /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash.conf
	```

3. To stop all services

	```
	$ docker-compose stop
	```
	

## Verify
1. Go to [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200) to verify elasticsearch is running.
2. Go to [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) to verify kibana is running.
